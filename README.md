# ON Tunnel V2ray

Android VPN application: V2Ray/Xray (built-in core) and OpenVPN (through the "OpenVPN for Android" engine).

- Application ID: `com.ontunnel.app`
- App name: ON Tunnel
- Launcher icon: OT
- Minimum Android: 7.0 (API 24)
- Core: `libv2ray.aar` from `2dust/AndroidLibXrayLite`, pinned to `v26.10.31`
- Build: GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/android.yml`
- Language: **English only**

## Features

- Xray native core dependency is downloaded by CI.
- Android `VpnService` start/stop service and foreground notification.
- VLESS, VMess, Trojan URI parsing and custom JSON import by paste.
- **Full V2rayNG-style server editor** (address, port, UUID/password, flow, network: tcp/ws/grpc/httpupgrade/xhttp/h2, host, path, TLS/Reality, SNI, fingerprint, ALPN, allowInsecure, public key, short id, spiderX). Subscription servers stay locked.
- Telegram channel dialog shown on every app launch.
- Light / Dark / Auto theme (menu ⋮ → Theme), compact name-only server list, **Check update** in the menu, centered title, big connect button and a standalone **Update Servers** button.
- Local server list storage.
- **Hidden subscription update** – a hardcoded subscription URL is fetched silently on app launch and via the refresh button. The URL is **never displayed** in the UI.
- Success toast / message when new servers are added from the subscription.
- ABI-specific debug APK jobs for arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64 and x86.

## OpenVPN (new in 1.8)

OpenVPN profiles live next to V2Ray servers in the same list (key icon + protocol badge).

**Engine.** OpenVPN itself is *not* bundled. ON Tunnel drives the free
[OpenVPN for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn) app (`de.blinkt.openvpn`) through its
official remote AIDL API (`app/src/main/aidl/de/blinkt/openvpn/api`). The first connection asks for two one-time permissions
(allow ON Tunnel to control it, and the Android VPN dialog). Reason: that engine is GPLv2 and its author states that embedding it in a
closed UI app needs a paid licence, while use of the AIDL API from an external app is explicitly *not* covered by the licence.

**Adding profiles.** `Add server` → *Import OpenVPN file* (.ovpn picker), *New OpenVPN profile*, or paste/clipboard (auto-detected).
Username/password are optional and embedded as an inline `auth-user-pass` block.

**Connection types** (editor → *Connection type*):

| Type | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Direct | the `.ovpn` is passed to OpenVPN for Android unchanged (TCP or UDP) |
| HTTP payload | a local relay dials the server (optionally via an HTTP proxy), sends your payload, waits for `101`/`2xx`, then carries raw OpenVPN-over-TCP bytes |
| WebSocket | the relay performs a real RFC 6455 handshake; OpenVPN is wrapped in masked binary frames only when the server proves it is a real WebSocket server (`Sec-WebSocket-Accept`), otherwise it is carried as a raw pipe (ping/pong handled) |
| HTTP Custom (legacy 5.1.26) | behaves like the old HTTP Custom: payload sent as written, TLS certificate never validated (any SNI/front domain), any `101`/`2xx` reply or silence switches to a raw pipe, never framed |

Payload / WebSocket can use TLS with a custom **SNI** (and an optional *allow insecure* switch), a **connect-to** override (CDN edge / front
domain) and a custom Host header. Payload tags: `[crlf] [cr] [lf] [host] [port] [host_port] [ua] [ws_key] [split] [delay_split]`.
Example: `GET / HTTP/1.1[crlf]Host: [host][crlf]Upgrade: websocket[crlf]Connection: Upgrade[crlf][crlf]`.

How the relay works: the profile is rewritten to `proto tcp-client` + `remote 127.0.0.1 <port>`, and the relay's upstream IP is added as
`route <ip> 255.255.255.255 net_gateway` so the relay's own socket bypasses the tunnel (no loop). The server must expose OpenVPN over **TCP**
behind the payload/WebSocket endpoint (UDP cannot be wrapped).

The relay core is plain Java (`app/src/main/java/com/ontunnel/app/ovpn`) and is covered by `tools/ovpn-core-test` (run in CI).

## UI changes in 1.8

Pulsing connect button with live connection timer, status detail line, protocol badges (VLESS · WS · TLS, OpenVPN · WebSocket…),
rounded server cards, and an *Add server* bottom sheet.

## Subscription URL

Edit the constant in `MainActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
private const val SUBSCRIPTION_URL = "https://example.com/your-subscription-link"
```

Replace with your real subscription link. While it still contains `example.com` the auto-update is skipped.

## UI changes in 1.5

- App icon replaced with the same shield glyph shown in the connected-state notification (`ic_launcher.xml`), so the launcher icon and the VPN notification icon now match.
- Removed the standalone **Update Servers** button from the home screen. The home screen now shows only the connect button and the server list; refreshing the subscription is done from the menu ⋮ → **Check update** (also still runs automatically once on launch).

## Hardening in 1.4

- The subscription and Telegram URLs are no longer plain strings in the dex – see `SecureStrings.kt` (XOR-obfuscated, decoded only at runtime).
- `classes.dex` is now R8-minified, repackaged and stripped of debug/source info on **both** the debug build (what CI produces) and release, see `proguard-rules.pro` and `app/build.gradle.kts`. Class/method names are renamed and flattened, logging calls are stripped, so a decompiled APK is far harder to read or patch.
- `IntegrityGuard.kt` can detect a re-signed/repackaged copy of the app (someone edited the dex, rebuilt and re-signed it with a different key) and disable the VPN connect button if the signature doesn't match yours. It is **off by default** – fill in `EXPECTED_SHA256` with your release certificate's SHA-256 once you have a signed build (see the comment in that file for how to read the hash on-device).
- None of this can stop someone from modifying their own copy of an open-source Android app on their own device – no on-device scheme can. What it does is make a silently redistributed, tampered build detectable and stop it from functioning, and make the strings and logic meaningfully harder to lift with a quick decompile.

## Fixed in 1.2

`core init failed ... xray.xudp.basekey: invalid value (BaseKey must be 32 bytes)` – the XUDP key passed to `initCoreEnv` must be 32 random bytes encoded as URL-safe Base64 **without padding**. The service now generates and stores a valid key.

## Verification status

The source integration is committed, but a successful GitHub Actions build and real-device tunnel test have not yet been confirmed. TLS, Reality, WebSocket, gRPC and custom JSON profiles should be tested against working server links before distributing a release.


## Fix: OpenVPN + payload stuck in CONNECTRETRY

* **HTTP payload mode is now always raw after the reply.** Previously a `101 Switching Protocols` made the relay switch to
  WebSocket framing even in HTTP-payload mode, which corrupts the stream for injector-style servers (they expect plain OpenVPN bytes
  after the 101) - OpenVPN then just kept retrying.
* **Multi-request payloads** (decoy `GET /cdn-cgi/trace` + `ACL / ... Upgrade: websocket`): every complete request gets its own reply
  read, replies to all but the last are drained (Content-Length, chunked, or length-less bodies) and ignored; only the last reply must be
  `101` or `2xx`. Explicit `[split]` fragments of a single request are written without waiting for a reply.
* **Clear errors instead of silent retries:** a 3xx/4xx/5xx final reply now closes the connection and is shown in the red error card
  ("Server rejected the payload: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request").
* **WebSocket mode** has a new *WebSocket framing (RFC 6455)* switch. Turn it off for servers that become a plain TCP pipe after the 101.
* New *Decoy + ACL* payload template; tests in `tools/ovpn-core-test` (`PayloadScenarios`, `OvpnCoreTest`) run in CI.


## Fix: WebSocket payload not connecting + "Retrying connection" (OpenVPN)

* **WebSocket mode no longer corrupts raw servers.** The relay always wrapped OpenVPN in WebSocket frames after a `101`. Servers used with
  HTTP Custom / injector payloads turn into a plain TCP pipe after the `101`, so every OpenVPN packet was garbage to them and OpenVPN just
  kept retrying. Framing is now **Auto** by default: framed only if the reply contains `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` (every real RFC 6455 server sends it).
  The editor has a *WebSocket framing* choice: Auto / Always framed / Raw after 101.
* **New connection type "HTTP Custom (legacy 5.1.26)"** (see table above). Extra payload tags: `[crlf*N]` `[cr*N]` `[lf*N]` `[netData]`
  `[rotate=a;b;c]` `[random=a;b;c]` `[instant_split]`.
* **The relay retries by itself.** A failed dial, a connection closed during the handshake, a timeout or a `5xx` is retried up to 3 times
  *before* OpenVPN notices (OpenVPN's first bytes just wait in the socket). Every resolved IP of the server is tried. A `3xx/4xx` answer is
  definitive and reported immediately.
* **OpenVPN never gives up.** The generated profile used `connect-retry-max 6`; after six failures OpenVPN quit. It is removed (unlimited) and
  `hand-window 120` gives slow handshakes room.
* **Automatic reconnect in the app.** If OpenVPN quits while connecting, the relay cannot start, or an attempt is still not connected after
  30 s (stuck in CONNECTRETRY/WAIT), ON Tunnel restarts the engine + relay on its own (up to 8 times, counter shown in the status line). The
  numeric noise in "Retrying connection – -2" is hidden. A user disconnect never triggers a reconnect.
* New tests: `tools/ovpn-core-test/HttpCustomScenarios.java` (run in CI).
